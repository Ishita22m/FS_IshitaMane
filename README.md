Student Commute Optimizer – A Carpooling and Route-Sharing Application for Students

2. Problem Statement
Many students commute individually to schools/colleges, leading to traffic congestion, higher travel costs, and increased carbon footprint.
Lack of an organized platform makes it difficult for students traveling along the same route to coordinate and share rides.

3. Proposed Solution
The Student Commute Optimizer is a full-stack application that:
Matches students with overlapping routes.
Shows nearby students on a map.
Allows anonymous chat using unique usernames.
Ensures safety & privacy while promoting cost-saving and eco-friendly travel.

4.  Tools and Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js + Google Maps API (for location & routes).
Backend: Node.js + Express.js (handles API requests).
Database: MongoDB Atlas (free cloud DB).
Authentication: Anonymous login with unique usernames.
Chat: Socket.IO (real-time chat).
